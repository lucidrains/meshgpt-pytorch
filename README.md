## Install

```bash
$ pip install meshgpt-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch

from meshgpt_pytorch import (
    MeshAutoencoder,
    MeshTransformer
)

# autoencoder

autoencoder = MeshAutoencoder(
    num_discrete_coors = 128
)

# mock inputs

vertices = torch.randn((2, 121, 3))            # (batch, num vertices, coor (3))
faces = torch.randint(0, 121, (2, 64, 3))      # (batch, num faces, vertices (3))

# make sure faces are padded with `-1` for variable lengthed meshes

# forward in the faces

loss = autoencoder(
    vertices = vertices,
    faces = faces
)

loss.backward()

# after much training...
# you can pass in the raw face data above to train a transformer to model this sequence of face vertices

transformer = MeshTransformer(
    autoencoder,
    dim = 512,
    max_seq_len = 768
)

loss = transformer(
    vertices = vertices,
    faces = faces
)

loss.backward()

# after much training of transformer, you can now sample novel 3d assets

faces_coordinates, face_mask = transformer.generate()

# (batch, num faces, vertices (3), coordinates (3)), (batch, num faces)
# now post process for the generated 3d asset

```

For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX0dKw4SjI">text-conditioned 3d shape synthesis</a>, simply set `condition_on_text = True` on your `MeshTransformer`, and then pass in your list of descriptions as the `texts` keyword argument

ex.
```python
transformer = MeshTransformer(
    autoencoder,
    dim = 512,
    max_seq_len = 768,
    condition_on_text = True
)


loss = transformer(
    vertices = vertices,
    faces = faces,
    texts = ['a high chair', 'a small teapot'],
)

loss.backward()

# after much training of transformer, you can now sample novel 3d assets conditioned on text

faces_coordinates, face_mask = transformer.generate(
    texts = ['a long table'],
    cond_scale = 3.  # a cond_scale > 1. will enable classifier free guidance - can be placed anywhere from 3. - 10.
)

```

If you want to tokenize meshes, for use in your multimodal transformer, simply invoke `.tokenize` on your autoencoder (or same method on autoencoder trainer instance for the exponentially smoothed model)

```python

mesh_token_ids = autoencoder.tokenize(
    vertices = vertices,
    faces = faces
)

# (batch, num face vertices, residual quantized layer)
```

## Typecheck

At the project root, run

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

## Todo

- [x] autoencoder
    - [x] encoder sageconv with torch geometric
    - [x] proper scatter mean accounting for padding for meaning the vertices and RVQ the vertices before gathering back for decoder
    - [x] complete decoder and reconstruction loss + commitment loss
    - [x] handle variable lengthed faces
    - [x] add option to use residual LFQ, latest quantization development that scales code utilization
    - [x] xcit linear attention in encoder and decoder
    - [x] figure out how to auto-derive `face_edges` directly from faces and vertices
    - [x] embed any derived values (area, angles, etc) from the vertices before sage convs
    - [ ] add an extra graph conv stage in the encoder, where vertices are enriched with their connected vertex neighbors, before aggregating into faces. make optional
    - [ ] allow for encoder to noise the vertices, so autoencoder is a bit denoising. consider conditioning decoder on noise level, if varying

- [ ] transformer
    - [x] properly mask out eos logit during generation
    - [x] make sure it trains
        - [x] take care of sos token automatically
        - [x] take care of eos token automatically if sequence length or mask is passed in
    - [x] handle variable lengthed faces
        - [x] on forwards
        - [x] on generation, do all eos logic + substitute everything after eos with pad id
    - [x] generation + cache kv

- [x] trainer wrapper with hf accelerate
    - [x] autoencoder - take care of ema
    - [x] transformer

- [x] text conditioning using own CFG library
    - [x] complete preliminary text conditioning
    - [x]  make sure CFG library can support passing in arguments to the two separate calls when cond scaling (as well as aggregating their outputs)
    - [ ] polish up the magic dataset decorator and see if it can be moved to CFG library
- [x] hierarchical transformers (using the RQ transformer)
- [x] fix caching in simple gateloop layer in other repo
- [x] local attention
- [x] fix kv caching for two-staged hierarchical transformer - 7x faster now, and faster than original non-hierarchical transformer
- [x] fix caching for gateloop layers
- [x] allow for customization of model dimensions of fine vs coarse attention network
- [x] figure out if autoencoder is really necessary - it is necessary, ablations are in the paper
    - [x] when mesh discretizer is passed in, one can inject inter-face attention with the relative distance
    - [x] additional embeddings (angles, area, normal), can also be appended before coarse transformer attention

- [ ] make transformer efficient
    - [ ] reversible networks

- [ ] speculative decoding option

- [ ] spend a day on documentation
