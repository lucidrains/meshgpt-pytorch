## MeshGPT - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15475">MeshGPT</a>, SOTA Mesh generation using Attention, in Pytorch

Will also add text conditioning, for eventual text-to-3d asset

## Pre-trained autoencoder on the Objaverse dataset (14k meshes, only meshes that have max 250 faces): 
This is contains only autoencoder model, I'm currently training the transformer model.<br/>
Visit the discussions [Pre-trained autoencoder & data sourcing](https://github.com/lucidrains/meshgpt-pytorch/discussions/66) for more information about the training and details about the progression.

<br/>
The auto-encoder results shows that it's possible to compress many mesh models into tokens which then can be decoded and reconstruct a mesh near perfection!<br/>
The auto-encoder was trained for 9 epochs for 20hrs on a single P100 GPU.<br/><br/>

The more compute heavy part is to train a transformer that can use these tokens learn the auto-encoder 'language'.<br/>
Using the codes as a vocabablity and learn the relationship between the the codes and it's ordering requires a lot compute to train compared to the auto-encoder.<br/>
So by using a single P100 GPU it will probaly take a few weeks till I can get out a pre-trained transformer. 
<br/>
Let me know if you wish to donate any compute or I can provide you with the dataset + training notebook.

```
num_layers = 23 
autoencoder = MeshAutoencoder(     
   decoder_dims_through_depth = (128,) * 3 + (192,) * 4 + (256,) * num_layers + (384,) * 3,   
   dim_codebook = 192 , 
   codebook_size = 16384 , 
   dim_area_embed = 16,
   dim_coor_embed = 16, 
   dim_normal_embed = 16,
   dim_angle_embed = 8,

   attn_decoder_depth = 8,
   attn_encoder_depth = 4
 ).to("cuda")    
```

#### Results, it's about 14k models so with the limited training time and hardware It's a great result.
